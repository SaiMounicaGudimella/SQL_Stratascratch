## Users By Average Session Time



#### Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events on that day, consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit, with an obvious restriction that load time event should happen before exit time event . Output the user_id and their average session time.



select user_id, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, load_time, exit_time)) session_time
from (
select *, DATE(timestamp), MAX(IF(action="page_load", timestamp, NULL)) load_time, MIN(IF(action="page_exit", timestamp, NULL)) exit_time
from facebook_web_log
group by user_id, DATE(timestamp)
order by user_id, DATE(timestamp)
) t
group by user_id
having session_time IS NOT NULL
